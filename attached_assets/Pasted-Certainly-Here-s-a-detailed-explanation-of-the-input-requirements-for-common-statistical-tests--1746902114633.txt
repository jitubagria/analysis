Certainly. Here's a **detailed explanation** of the input requirements for common statistical tests, followed by a **summary table** for quick reference.

---

### 1. **T-Test (Independent and Paired)**

* **Test Variable**: Must be **numeric** (e.g., blood pressure, platelet count).
* **Grouping Variable**: Must be **binary categorical** (e.g., Male/Female, System A/System B).
* **Reason**: The test compares **means** between two groups.

---

### 2. **ANOVA (One-Way)**

* **Dependent Variable**: Must be **numeric**.
* **Factor (Group Variable)**: Must be **categorical** with **two or more levels**.
* **Reason**: ANOVA compares **means** across multiple groups.

---

### 3. **Chi-Square Test (of Independence)**

* **Both Variables**: Must be **categorical**.
* **Reason**: Tests association between categorical groups (e.g., disease status vs treatment type).

---

### 4. **Correlation (Pearson/Spearman)**

* **Both Variables**: Must be **numeric**.
* **Pearson**: Assumes linearity and normal distribution.
* **Spearman**: Rank-based; works with non-normal data.
* **Reason**: Measures strength and direction of association between two continuous variables.

---

### 5. **Linear Regression**

* **Dependent Variable**: Must be **numeric**.
* **Independent Variable(s)**: Can be **numeric** or **categorical** (categorical is internally converted to dummy variables).
* **Reason**: Predicts numeric outcome based on one or more predictors.

---

### 6. **Logistic Regression**

* **Dependent Variable**: Must be **binary categorical** (e.g., Yes/No).
* **Independent Variable(s)**: Can be **numeric or categorical**.
* **Reason**: Models the probability of a binary outcome.

### Summary Table: Variable Types for Common Tests

| Test Type            | Dependent Variable   | Independent / Grouping Variable | Notes                                             |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| T-Test               | Numeric              | Categorical (2 groups)          | Use Paired t-test for pre/post comparisons        |
| ANOVA                | Numeric              | Categorical (2+ groups)         | Shows differences in means across multiple groups |
| Chi-Square Test      | Categorical          | Categorical                     | Tests independence between categorical variables  |
| Pearson Correlation  | Numeric              | Numeric                         | Requires linear and normal data                   |
| Spearman Correlation | Numeric (or ordinal) | Numeric (or ordinal)            | Non-parametric, no need for normality             |
| Linear Regression    | Numeric              | Numeric or Categorical          | Predicts continuous outcome                       |
| Logistic Regression  | Categorical (binary) | Numeric or Categorical          | Predicts binary outcome                           |

### Conclusion

Your implementation is **statistically sound** in showing only numeric columns for t-test and ANOVA. As you extend support to other tests (e.g., Chi-square, correlation, regression), applying similar input validation based on the above will ensure correct test logic and improve user experience.
